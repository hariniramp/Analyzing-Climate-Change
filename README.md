# data-512-final

## Project Summary
My final project for the Human-Centered Data Science class concerns the role of ethnicity in the workplace. Often, employers knowingly or unknowingly can discriminate against resumes or profiles of people whose names might sound African-American, as opposed to Caucasian. The motivation for this project will be to see whether how a person's name sounds actually affects whether they are offered interview calls for jobs. By conducting an exploratory data analysis and hypothesis tests on this subject, I aim to gauge what factors affect resumes that get follow-up calls, and if ethnicity or race play some part in it.
