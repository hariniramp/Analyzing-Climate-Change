## Project Summary

The issue of climate change is something that has been significantly impacting the world since the early 19th century. Scientists have argued that greenhouse gas emissions could be contributing to global warming. Over the years, we've observed increases in global temperature, depletion of precious natural resources and severe damage to the environment. Solutions to these problems involve policies on green energy, conservation and education in climate change. Another observable factor is public opinion on climate change. Often, we see that policies around climate change, or lack thereof, indicate that the threat is one that people do not take seriously enough. In fact, a huge subsection of the population firmly believes that climate change is a hoax, and not a real problem whatsoever. For us to affect real impact in the realm of climate change, it is necessary to educate people on the matter, in conjunction with instituting progressive policy.

The topic of climate change was interesting to me for two reasons: 

i. I wanted to see (quantitatively and concretely) how human actions have contributed to changes in the climate.

ii. I wanted to analyze the "debate" around the existence of climate change.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses

My goal with the project was to address trends and patterns in climate change as well as public opinion around it. To this end, I divided my analysis into two main questions, with subsections devoted to various analyses. I would like to answer some of the following questions concerning both climate change itself, as well as people's perceptions regarding it.


*   **What factors influence the way people think about climate change?**


1.   Does a state's political affiliation impact the way they answer certain questions about climate change?

    **Hypothesis: Republican states are likely to have greater percentages opposing ideals of climate change and policies to mitigate global warming, than Democratic states.** 
2.   Do states with higher surface temperatures, sea levels perceive a greater threat from global warming?
3.   What are the renewable energy, fossil fuel consumption patterns of states that perceive global warming as a big threat versus those states that don't?

*   **How has surface temperature evolved over the years and what factors might have affected this evolution?**

1.   Do states that gain more energy burning fossil fuels have higher surface temperatures? Do higher temperatures correlate with more air pollution, higher sea levels, etc?
2.   What can we project the global surface temperature to be in the next 20 years? 30 years?
